	<h1> Process for the assignment on non-military drones </h1>
	<h2> by Rheaa Rao </h2>

	<body>
	<p> It was hard to collect data for this assignment. I filed a FOIA with the Federal Aviation Administration about drone accidents in the past year. I was specifically looking for information about non-military drones because the FAA has been tightening regulations for them. The only information I could find about non-military drone accidents was a Rochester NY open database. The dataset was quite small so I divided that according to which model of drone had the most accidents.

  <p> What I did find with the FAA was a database of close calls with drones (near accidents) in the past year which I mapped using cartodb. I made two layers for it- 2014 and 2015 so readers can see how much it increased in the past year. I also spoke to a press person at the FAA and read more of their releases for a better story. I combed meet-up websites for recreational drone groups for information as well. </p>

<p> The coding was fairly simple. I used the iframe of the map and imbedded it in. I saved the graph as an image and coding it with css. I chose a fairly neutral background colour and text that one can read without straining. </p>
