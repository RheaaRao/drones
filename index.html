	<h1> Recreational drones are looming too close for comfort</h1>
	<h2> by Rheaa Rao </h2>

	<p>The Federal Aviation Administration has made it compulsory for small, non-military drones to be registered following safety violations that the FAA says have steadily increased in 2015. </p>

    <p> Registration must be done by February 19th 2016 for unmanned aerial vehicles (or drones, in common parlance) that weigh more than half a pound. According to the FAA, with 342,000 registrations so far, there are currently more registered drones than manned aircraft. </p>

    <p> In 2015, 650 close calls with manned aerial vehicles were reported- nearly double of 238 "hit and miss" drones in 2014. Through registration, the FAA hopes to inculcate responsible behavior with non-military drone users. A 2015 survey showed that 47% of US respondents believed that the use of non-military drones must be closely regulated. </p>

    <p> Non-military drones are used for business or recreational purposes. Amazon intends to use drones to make speedy deliveries to high density areas. Interestingly, only 14% respondents said they were ready to order their first drone delivered package within the next year. A majority of consumers are still not ready to conceive of this option for the next few years. </p>

    <p> Recreational drones are usually owned by hobbyists- to take breathtaking aerial shots or sometimes just for the thrill of it. Artists are also increasingly taking up drones. In April 2015, KATSU, a prolific New York based "vandal artist" used a small drone to etch a red line on a billboard with Kendall Jenner. </p>

    

    <p> In the past year there have been 28 reported non-military drone accidents in the USA. Interestingly, twenty-one of these accidents have been of <a href="http://rochester.nydatabases.com/map/domestic-drone-accidents"> "small unnamed drones." </a> These drones have either not been traced back to an owner or a model. </p>
